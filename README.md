# ZOMATO-DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECT-
Zomato Data Analysis Project
Overview

This project involves data analysis using Python to gain insights from Zomato's food delivery business. Zomato averages 17.5 million monthly transacting customers and has seen an 8.7% year-on-year increase in active food delivery restaurant partners. This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations to answer key questions about customer behavior and restaurant performance.

Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:

1-Identifying the types of restaurants the majority of customers order from.
2-Analyzing the number of votes each type of restaurant has received from customers.
3-Determining the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received.
4-Calculating the average spending per order by couples who primarily order online.
5-Identifying which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating.
6-Determining which type of restaurant received more offline orders to offer targeted promotions.
